## Computation
- Before machines, there is meaning.
- Computing is a way of knowing.
	- A lens through which we interpret reality.
	- A method of structuring thought.
	- A framework for encoding, transforming and communicating information.

## The Role of Philosophy
- What is information?
	- Is it objective, subjective or relational?
- What is computation?
	- Is it mechanical symbol manipulation or is it identical with thought?
- Where are the boundaries?
	- What cannot be computed, represented or known?
- Engineers must know what is possible before building.
- Scientists must know what is measurable before claiming knowledge.
- Ethicists must know what is meaningful before deciding responsibility.

- Plato
	- Saw reality as structured by eternal forms — computation echoes this in abstraction
- Aristotle.
	- Formal logic {syllogisms} -> precursor to Boolean algebra and rule-based reasoning.
- Leibniz
	- Dreamed of a "calculus of reason" where disputes could be settled by calculation.
- Wiener
	- Cybernetics connected feedback, information and control across biology and machines.
