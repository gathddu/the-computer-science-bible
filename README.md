# The Computer Science Bible

## About
** The Computer Science Bible** is an open, collaborative effort to create a comprehensive guide to the theory, practice and wisdom of computing. It is not a collection of facts but a deeply interconnected knowledge graph designed to build true mastery.

This repository is the canonical source for the CSB, structured as a digital garden of notes, so you can browse on GitHub or, ideally, clone and explore within an application like [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md).

## Philosophy
- Every topic is broken down to its fundamental truths, avoiding rote memorization in favor of genuine understanding.
- Bridge the gap between abstract theory and practical application.
- No concept exists in a vacuum. We must trace the lineage of ideas to understand why things are the way they are.
- The CSB aims to be a web of knowledge that reveals the hidden connections between disparate fields of computing.
